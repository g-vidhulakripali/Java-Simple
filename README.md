Simple Java Basic Codes
Implement a static method which finds the smallest positive integer n for which
the greatest common divisor of the number of divisors of n and the number of
divisors of n3 is not a power of 2. Examples: 3 has 2 divisors, 33 = 27 has 4
divisors and gcd(2,4) = 2. So, 3 is not the right number. 4 has 3 divisors, 43 =
64 has 7 divisors and gcd(3,7) = 1. So, 4 is not the right number.
